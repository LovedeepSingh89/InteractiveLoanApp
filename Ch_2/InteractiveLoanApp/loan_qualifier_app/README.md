# Interactive Loan Qualifier Application

In this challenge, I compare the attributes of a potential borrower to the loan offerings of a set of banks. I connect the monthly debt to income ratio and the loan to value ratio to the list of available loans. I also incorpoate a function that allows users to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.
